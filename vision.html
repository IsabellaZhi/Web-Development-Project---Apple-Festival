            <p>This year, the 39th Annual Apple Harvest Festival returned to its traditional, large–scale format with social-distancing precautious after a cut-down version of the festival, Apple Festive, presented in 2020. </p>
            <p><strong>As a long standing tradition in Ithaca, the fest brings local high-quality farmers to downtown area to gather with the local population. The festival helps local farms to build sustainable business models by offering them the chance to promote products in creative and interactive ways to merchants and customers.</strong></p>

            <p>Beautiful local farms have been long-standing in the scope of the great Ithaca area in known history. There are many historic barns throughout America that are precious, endangered resource representing the historical landscape and businesses, deeply holding the unique sense of place embodied by these significant buildings, sites, landscapes and communities. In this age of growth and expansion, they are swiftly becoming extinct. This brochure produced by The New York State Barn Coalition introduces a collection of barns built in the early 1800s and advocates for fostering conservation, restoration, adaptation, and renewal in designing and shaping new environments and building uses. </p>

            <p>One of the spectaculor chances for local farms is the Ithaca Farmers Market. The market has developed from a local farmer venue in 1973 to a thriving community gathering place in the beautiful Finger Lakes region. Now, it consists of 130 active members within 30 miles of the market. There are three categories of vendors: agriculture, food and artisan, and each farm at the market has been through an application and jurying process to guarantee quality.</p>
            <p>We are confident that the honorable history of the fabulous organic farms and the supportive community markets around the Ithaca area will continue as more and more college students are willing to advocate for them and implement tech projects that function as platforms for them to prosper. We are looking forward to attract more attention over our outstanding farms by having farm open hours and opening various fieldwork opportunities for local K-12 school. We need the support from our community to help the Ithaca farms grow and prosper!</p>
